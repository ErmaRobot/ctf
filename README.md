## What is a Wargame

C.T.F, or capture the flag, is a game that challenges the player to find a particular string, or flag, in files, directories, and code by exploiting vulnerabilites. Also called [Wargames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wargame_(hacking)) they can be found around the internet if you know how to look for them.

## Why play a Wargame

As they usually revolve about exploiting vulnerable code or having a deep knowledge of webservers and operating systems Wargames are a great way to build your skills as a programmer. Cyber security and writing secure code are becomig more and more relevant and important as our world becomes more reliant on networked computers which store more and more of our important, personal information. 

## Which games do I play

overthewire.org has a great collection of games for a variety of skill levels.
bandit - Linux
natas - Web
krypton - encryption
and 
Leviathan - Linux

They have many more, but these are the ones I have worked on.

The other two that I have played are websec.fr and io, io.netgarage. 

## Pretty cool right

Here I have a collection of write ups for the challenges I have completed along with code as needed for the challenge. I use primarily python with requests and beautiful soup for webserver based challenges and shell, python, or c/c++ for other challenges as well as gdb linux commands as necessary.

# SPOILER ALERT

I have had many troubles trying to complete some of these challenges myself. Looking up info for how to overcome them is natural, but don't cheat! There are answers ahead. These challenges can be like trick questions or riddles. Once you know the answer you will never forget. Always try your best and compete with honor!
