Another git challenge. This one wasn't so bad. I think I am getting into the git frame of mind. Parusing the repo it is apparent that there aren't many files here. The
obligatory README and thats about it other than internal git stuff. README just contains the taunting phrase "empty file... muahaha" complete with evil laughter, of 
course. Well the last challenge had multpile branches and I know how to deal with that now! git branch -a just shows the local branch we started when we cloned the
repo and the remote branch that we cloned from. Damn! Maybe there are notes attached to the one file. Nope! No notes. Maybe tags... Cool! We have a tag called secret,
but it's a blob object. git cat-file secret reveals the flag.
