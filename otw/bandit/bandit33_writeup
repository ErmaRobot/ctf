In the meantime, you could play some of our other wargames.

Final Thoughts

I really like this wargame. It is actually the first game that I have completed to the end. Bandit is pretty easy compared to others games I have started, but I feal 
that I have learned quite alot playing the game. Among the things I have learned are the deeper workings of git, how to use netcat and s_client, potential security
problems using more and that different terminals will interact with vim differently, and that I should slow down when reading manpages and keep an open mind. Many
thans to the creators and maintainers of this game. I had a great time playing!
