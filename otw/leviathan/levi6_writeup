Leviathan6

Running the setuid executable in the home directory, leviathan6, it prints a message saying that it is to be called with an argument, a 4 digit code. Running 
leviathan6 in strings and with ltrace we don't see a code stored in the program. There is a call to atoi though which means that the string we enter in the argument 
will be turned into an integer and probably compared to an int that is hard coded in the program and not stored in a variable. There is probably a way to disassemble
the program and find that number but it is only a 4 digit code. We could brute force it pretty easily.

### brute.sh

#! /bin/bash

for t in {0..9}; do
  for h in {0..9}; do
    for d in {0..9}; do
      for o in {0..9}; do
        echo -n "$t$h$d$o: ";
        ~/leviathan6 $t$h$d$o;
      done;
    done;
  done;
done
