Leviathan7

This is the end of the wargame. We made it!

### CONGRATULATIONS
Well Done, you seem to have used a *nix system before, now try something more serious.

This game was still pretty easy, but a nice step up from bandit. I learned about using the ltrace and strings commands and how handy they can be for looking into a 
program. I am actually surprised with ltrace and strace that they can intercept library and system calls. It makes sense as these are messages being sent to other 
binaries, shared libraries and the operating system, but still not something that I knew existed before. It also makes sense that you can peer into an executable file
and see strings. I just would have used xxd before and suffered trying to make sense of the output. My only complaint for this game is the length, but I am feeling
pretty confident after bandit and now leviathan so I think I will try my hand at a more difficult wargame.
