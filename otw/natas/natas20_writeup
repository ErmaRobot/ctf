I love the session hacking line of challenges. The idea of maliciously altering session data, persistent data stored on the server, used to seem impossible. This level in particular felt like a hacker level up for me. All in all it's not even that complex. I think the concept behind this level is true but I doubt it is so straight forward in the wild. What is the challenge? We are an admin if we have a 1 stored in the admin key in our Session array. The array holds one other item which is whatever name we submited in the form. However, looking in the source, we see that the session data is written into a file and then later read linewise. Submitting 'a\nadmin 1' through python requests solves the challenge. What I was getting at earlier with this type of attack not being so straight forward is that in the level everything is written linewise making it pretty simple to cheat. I don't think that a vulnerability like this would be so easy to take advantage of in the wild. However I now know that this kind of thing is possible. Injecting malicious data into session data is a thing I kind of know how to do now!
