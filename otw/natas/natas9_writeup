Natas9

This one was alot of fun. Looking at the source file there is a line passthru("grep -i $key dictionary.txt"); The user input is supplied directly to a shell without any sanitization. The output of the system command is returned and printed to the screen. What a perfect place for a command injection! I'll use requests for python to make a post request and then I'll read the returned html with BeautifulSoup.

res = requests.post(url, auth=(name, word), data={'submit':'Search', 'needle':'; cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas10;'})

needle will hold the command injection, described below

; separates us from the grep command so that we can start our own command
cat ... reads the password file, and
; separates us from the rest of the string being sent to the server

print(BeautifulSoup(res.text).prettify()) shows us easy to read html

And we can see the password just hanging out waiting for us!
