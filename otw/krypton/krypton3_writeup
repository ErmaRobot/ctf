Krypton3

The first big leap in skill for the krypton game, and a sold level up in my understanding of the analysis of ciphers. I did alot of research to figure out the cipher for level 4. The setup for this level is that there are a number of found files that have all been encrypted with the same monoalphabetic enryption scheme. The method is different than the more simple ceasar/rotaion ciphers previously encountered. The scheme works by taking two copies of the alpabet and randomly shuffling one of them. The plain text is translated from the plain alphabet to the shuffled alphabet resulting in the cipher text that we are given. Our job is to figure out what the random alphabet is. In my research I came across the technique of Frequency Analysis. By comparing the relative frequency of english characters and cipher characters as single characters, pairs, groups of three, and groups of four, we can start to see patterns and possible correlations. These groupings of characters are called n_grams. I downloaded some n_gram frequency charts for english from the internet. Then I counted the frequency of cipher n_grams and wrote them to a csv file side by side with the english n_grams. I used the resulting table to make an initial guess at the encryption key and to aid me at changing that initial guess until I came up with the key.The last part I did was pretty much brute force, but I eventually got the correct answer and decoded the cipher.
